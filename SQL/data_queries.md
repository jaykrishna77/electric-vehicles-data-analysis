# Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis with SQL
## üìñ  Introduction
This project involves analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data using a combination of SQL, Python, and Tableau. The objective is to uncover insights into electric vehicle market trends, such as year-wise sales growth, top-performing models, and pricing distribution. SQL is used to query and retrieve data, Python is used for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau is used for interactive visualizations. This document includes the SQL queries executed and their respective output screenshots.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains:
- **Geographic Information**:
  - `Country`
  - `City`
  - `State`
  - `Postal Code`

- **Vehicle Identification**
  - `VN (1-10)` (Likely a unique identifier or sequence number)
  - `DOL Vehicle` (Department of Licensing identifier)
  - `Make`
  - `Model`
  - `Model Year`
- **Technical Specifications**
  - `Electric Vehicle Type` (e.g., BEV, PHEV)

  - **Mid-range** (50K‚Äì80K) and **budget** (<$50K) segments show different adoption patterns.




## üîÆ Key Takeaways
1. **Urban tech hubs drive adoption** - Seattle metro accounts for disproportionate share

2. **Range remains premium feature** - Only 5 brands have >20% of vehicles exceeding 200 miles

3. **Tesla's market dominance is structural** - Holds 4 of top 6 most popular models

4. **BEVs winning over PHEVs** - 3:1 ratio suggests charging infrastructure improvements

5. **Rural areas lag significantly** in both adoption rates and available vehicle ranges

## üìà Recommended Next Steps
1. **Correlate charging infrastructure density** with adoption rates by city

2. **Analyze state incentives** impact on brand preferences

3. **Study used EV market** - How do older models (pre-2015) perform in secondary markets?

4. **Compare Tesla's service network coverage** vs other brands in rural areas

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals **strong geographic and economic trends** in EV adoption, with **Tesla leading in both technology and market penetration**. Future growth may depend on **expanding charging networks, lowering costs, and improving battery efficiency** to attract mainstream buyers.
